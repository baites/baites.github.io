## Goals

These notes contents were produced as part of my different projects, that for any some reason stayed in my archives. Also some of the contents are the result of some exercise that ended providing me with some non-trivial knowledge from at least from my perspective.

My goal is find a place for this knowledge, because a lot of it although simple, they are the foundation of a lot my projects. Another goal is to show of *STEM* skills can be used for specific applications and personal entertainment and enlightenment.

## My interdisciplinarian credentials

My name is Victor E. Bazterra I am currently a System Engineering at [Mathworks](https://www.mathworks.com/). I was before a scientist working at experimental High Energy Physics for [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://phys.uic.edu/) as part of [D0](https://www-d0.fnal.gov/) ([Fermilab](http://www.fnal.gov/)) and [CMS](https://home.cern/about/experiments/cms) ([CERN](https://home.cern/)) collaborations. This was after I got my PhD physics working in
simulations related to Material Science at [University of Buenos Aires](https://www.df.uba.ar/es/)
in collaboration of [Center For High Performance Computing](https://www.chpc.utah.edu/) at [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/).
