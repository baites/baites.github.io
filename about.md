## Goals

The content of these notes was produced as I research for projects or just for fun. Some of the materials are the result of some exercise that ended providing me with some non-trivial knowledge from at least from my perspective. Due to its informal nature, much of this information stayed in my archives.

My goal is to find a place for this knowledge in where some were part of the foundation for some of my projects. Another goal is to how *STEM* skills are applied in specific developments, and also a source for personal entertainment and enlightenment.

## My interdisciplinarian credentials

My name is Victor E. Bazterra I am currently a System Engineering at [Mathworks](https://www.mathworks.com/). I was before a scientist working at experimental High Energy Physics for [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://phys.uic.edu/) as part of [D0](https://www-d0.fnal.gov/) ([Fermilab](http://www.fnal.gov/)) and [CMS](https://home.cern/about/experiments/cms) ([CERN](https://home.cern/)) collaborations. I got my Ph.D. physics working in
simulations related to Material Science at [University of Buenos Aires](https://www.df.uba.ar/es/)
in collaboration of [Center For High Performance Computing](https://www.chpc.utah.edu/) at [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/).
