My initial need of queuing theory arose when working with distributed and parallel programs as part of my physics researcher. Later as engineer, it became fundamental for modeling distributed applications and system I started to work with. It also became one of the main sources of inspirations for automation, in where algorithm were derived from relationships originated from queuing theory.
