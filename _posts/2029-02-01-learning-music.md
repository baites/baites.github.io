# Introduction

A few years ago, I decided to learn the guitar on my own. The last time I try something related to music, I was a teenager and went nowhere. The goal is to learn something out of my comfort zone. Moreover, I always loved music, and I felt I was missing something important because I could not perform some music. 

After a year into the process, playing a few minutes consistently every day, I got stuck. I figured the problem was that I felt lost in the fretboard, and no matter how much I play, I was no getting any new insights about how music works other than from my own (and relatively limited) intuition.

So started learning some music theory. For the first time, I understood the importance of scales, in particular, Major and Minor scales, triads, chord progression, etc. I felt like learning how to read and write for the first time. A world of patterns and traditions suddenly opened. At that moment, my most influential books were Guitar Theory for Dummies by Desi Serna[^1], and Basic Music Theory by Jonathan Harnum[^2]. As usual, after I got some of the basics, I had questions than when I started.

I was a scientist until a few years ago, and now I am an engineer. My experience is that I learn better when having a model to guide me in my learning process. The model does not need to be complete or even right and its content might require constant updates.

With this blog, I start a new series of notes about music. A lot of the content can be described as music theory. However, my goal is to provide a model to **help me** *to make and perform music*. Most of the content is my way of describing what I am reading about music, its representation, and its internal structure. I will provide as many references as I can without intention to be exhaustive.

I have little or no expertise about the details discussed in here, therefore a diclaimer inspire by MIT license wording:

Therefore expect conceptual errors and constant updates the whole blog series.

# Music representation

There is a huge number of way to represent music. However, most of them fall in two categories[^3]:

* Literal notation: perfect representation of the music sound usually given and a time series.
* Symbolic notation: high level reprentation about the structure of of the music sound.

Signal processing uses for the most part some type of literal notation. By other hand, most of the music theory defines some kind of symbolic notation.
