# Introduction

A few years ago, I decided to learn to play the guitar on my own. The last time I tried, I was a teenager, and it went nowhere. My initial goal was to learn something out of my comfort zone. Also, I always loved music, and I felt that I was missing something important in my life because I could not perform some music.

After a year into the process, playing a few minutes consistently every day, I got stuck. I figured the problem was that I felt lost in the fretboard, and no matter how much I played, I was no getting any new insights about how music works other than what I gather by my own very limited intuition.

So started learning some music theory. For the first time, I understood the importance of scales, particularly Major and Minor scales, triads, chord progression, etc. I felt like learning how to read and write for the first time. A world of patterns and traditions suddenly opened. At that moment, my most influential books were Guitar Theory for Dummies by Desi Serna[^1], and Basic Music Theory by Jonathan Harnum[^2]. As usual, after I got some of the basics, I had way more questions than when I started.

I was a scientist until a few years ago, and now I am an engineer. In my experience, I learn better when having a model to guide me in my learning process. The model does not need to be complete or even correct, and I always assume that its content might require constant updates.

More recently, I was learning some abstract algebra. As a physics, I did not know a whole lot about math applied to discrete objects. However, as an engineer related to computing projects, I needed to learn new conceptual tools from algebra to help me to describe some of the problems I was facing. As I was learning more about music and its representation, I found that algebra seems to be also an excellent language to synthesize some of the music concepts.

With this blog, I will start a new series of notes about music. A lot of the content can perhaps be described as music theory. However, my goal is to provide a model to **help me** *making and performing music*. Most of the content is my way of describing what I am reading about music, its representation, and its internal structure. I will provide as many references as I can without any illusion to be exhaustive. This lack of knowledge about referential material is because I only offer sources I managed to read, however in some cases, in a hurry.

I will be using what can be called a quasi-formal approach using abstract algebra as a foundation. In it, I will concentrate on creating simple definitions without taking too much time to justify them completly. As a complement, I will provide as many references as **I know** about each topic for active readers interested to persue them further.

In no way am I claiming originality about this approach. I discovered early on that the music community knew about this for a long time, as you can see in the most recent referential work by Lewin[^3], Rings[^4], and Tymoczko[^5]. However, I think this series has at least the added value of reusing modern algebra concepts and notations rather than reinventing them in a musical context. I will follow closely the notation and algebra concepts as presented by excellent Introduction to **Abstract Algebra** by Jonathan Smith[^6].

Initially, I will avoid going too deep into the physics/acountic or psychoacoustics of music. However, it is likely I will not stay out of it for too long.

Finally, I have little or no expertise in the details discussed in this series of blogs. Therefore, I prepare a disclaimer inspired by MIT license wording.
