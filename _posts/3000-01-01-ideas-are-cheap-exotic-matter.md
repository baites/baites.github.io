## Ideas are cheap, details are priceless

I will kickstart in this blog a new recurrent set of posts labeled: Ideas are cheap, details are priceless. This entry is also the first one after stop writing for a while because of some personal issues I need to resolve. However, these are technical blogs that are not meant to be mass produced. I write them with the intention of practicing my writing, get some bragging rights about my creative and knowledge (or lack of them), and more important because I enjoy it.

I have little or no expertise about the details discussed in here. These are unscripted ideas I had in the past that eventually, I found out other people thought about them and worked out some of the details. The goal is twofold: **to show how seeding ideas are not that hard, and to point out the work of those who took the challenge of working out the details.** I would like to offer the following disclamer inspire by MIT license wording.

## Main idea(s)

In this post, I am planning to talk about exotic materials from outer space. Please do not get confused with [exotic matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_matter). They are not the same thing!

## Genesis of the idea

I was watching the other day the movie [Black Panther](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1825683/).  In the first scenes, you can see an asteroid approaching and eventually falling to earth made of the exotic Vibranium[^1]. Besides the point about the exact nature of the impact dynamic of an asteroid made of 50% Vibranium[^2], I always found frustrating that science fiction relies so much on a fact that it is easy to falsify[^3].

In this particular case, the issue is that the only material appealing for science fictions are the one that we can directly interact with them as humans. This means we want exotic materials with chemistry or more fundamentally we want them capable of interacting with the electromagnetic fields. Or equivalent as Richard Feynman clearly stated: "Matter is made of atoms."[^4]

The problem with atoms is that we know awfully a lot about them. We know so far most of their stable (and also not so stable) combinations that again are the ones needed to develop some technology[^5]. Therefore, it seems we are dreaming about the impossible.

There is however a way out of this issue if we assume the existence of very heavy stable nuclides in a configuration known as the island of stability[^6].

Recently, a more intriguing possibility is the existence of stable arrangements of quark matter made highly available up and down quarks[^7].
