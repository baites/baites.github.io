**My daughter in her late 5-year old**: *daddy, you know there is a language that can be used to write secrets.*

**Me**: *Say what now?*

**My daughter** (impatient face, signaling me to better start catching up): *That, there is a language that can be used to write secrets*.

**Me**: Well you can write a message in another language and if people do not know it, then its message is hidden to them.

**My daughter** (frustrated face): *No that. There is a language that can be used to write secrets and using a key...*

**Me** (WTF, 5 year old!?): *Where did you hear that?*

**My daughter** (ignoring me): *...and you can use a key to learn the secret message.*

**Me** (proud beyond words): *That is call cryptography! Where did you learn about that?*

**My daughter** (is-it-obvious face): *I do not know.*

**Me**: Do you want to learn how to do it?

**My daughter** (opening her eyes and putting her finally-you-are-becoming-useful face): yes!

**Me**: But be aware, you have to read and write and you just barely learned how to do...

**My daughter** (interrupting with her move-on face): *ok!*

**Me**: And we need to use math, you need to combine reading, writeing, and math as one thing...

**My daughter** (excited face): *Oh boy, oh boy, ...*

**Me**: Are you sure you want to do it?

**My daughter**: **YES!!!**
