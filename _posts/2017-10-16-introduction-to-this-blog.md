A few year ago I used to introduce myself as a scientist. However, a better term would be that I am an interdisciplinarian to reflect current background as engineer. This is following a somewhat arbitrary classification system that put science, technology, engineering, and math in different categories. The arbitrariness of this system is reflected in the recent need to name them together as `STEM` for educational purposes.

Even as scientist I tended to be a jack-of-all-trades, resulting that a lot knowledge I created when doing my job, could not be shown directly in the fields I was involved. I will not preach in this blog the benefits (or lack of) of my interdisciplinary tendencies because their are not entirely of my choice. Instead, I will claim a lot of knowledge is created in contexts cannot be easily shared for whatever reasons.

I am creating these notes/blogs as attempt to share some my knowledge that for contextual reasons stayed in my archives.
