A few year ago I used to introduce myself as a scientist. However, a better term would be that I am an interdisciplinarian to reflect current background as engineer. This is following a somewhat arbitrary classification system that put science, technology, engineering, and math in different categories. The arbitrariness of this system is reflected in the recent need to name them together as *STEM* for educational purposes.

Even as scientist I tended to be full stack researcher (aka jack-of-all-trades without the negative connotation), resulting that a lot knowledge I created when doing my job, that could not be shown directly in the fields I was involved in. I will not preach in this blog the benefits (or lack of) of my interdisciplinary tendencies because their are not entirely of my choice. Instead, I will claim a lot of knowledge is been created are done contexts cannot be easily shared for whatever reasons.

I am creating these notes/blogs as attempt to share some my knowledge that for contextual reasons stayed in my archives.

Blog style will be technical, however it should be easy to follow by anybody with a *STEM* background. Content would be designed as an academic exercise of a topic of choice. The minimal requirement is to provide some non trivial information throughout references, code or pseudo code, graphs, or math. As much as it will be possible, I will be creating examples using code. The source will be posted somewhere in one of my github repos.

So I hope you will enjoy these notes. I am working how to license the content of the blog. I will ask that as minimal requirement to reference back this blogs whenever you were inspire by it, or even better, if you find ways of using any of its content.
