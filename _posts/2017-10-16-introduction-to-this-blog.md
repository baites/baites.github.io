A few years ago I used to introduce myself as a scientist. However, a better term would be that I am an interdisciplinarian, to reflect my current background as engineer. This is following a somewhat arbitrary classification system that put science, technology, engineering, and math in different categories. The arbitrariness of this system is reflected in the recent need for naming them together as *STEM* for educational purposes.

Even as scientist I tended to be full stack researcher (aka jack-of-all-trades without the negative connotation), and as result, a lot of knowledge I created could not be shown directly in the fields I was involved in. I will not preach in this blog the benefits (or lack of) of my interdisciplinary tendencies because their are not entirely of my choice. Instead, I will claim that a lot of knowledge is been created are done in contexts in where it cannot be easily shared for whatever reasons.

I am creating these notes/post/blogs as attempt to share some this knowledge that for contextual reasons stayed in my archives.

The blog style will be technical, however it should be easy to follow by anybody with a *STEM* background. The content would be shown as an academic exercise of a topic of choice. The minimal requirement for creating post is that it should provide some non trivial information throughout references, code or pseudo code, graphs, or math. As much as it will be possible, I will be creating examples using code. Example sources will be posted somewhere in one of my github repos[^1].

So, I hope you will enjoy these notes. I will try to post once or twice a week based on my schedule. Be patient with me as I am new on this and error will be made. Now, without further ado

`Welcome to Notes Of An Interdisciplinarian!`
